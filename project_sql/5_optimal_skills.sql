/*
What are the most optimal skills to learn (AKA it is high-demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Analyst roles
- Concentrate on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Target skills that offer job seciruty (high-demand)
- And with Fiancial benefits (high avg salaries) offering startegic insights for career 
development in data Analytics

WE'D BE COMBINING THE TWO CTE'S EARLIER BUILT 
1. For Top demanded skills i.e., (skills_demand) and the count (skill_demand_count)
2. For Top Paying Skills i.e., (average_salary) and the AVG (avg_salary)
